# Active Directory Home Lab

## Objective

Build an Active Directory home lab using Windows Server, Windows 10, Sysmon, and Splunk to monitor network traffic and activity, with Kali Linux for attack simulations 
and Splunk Forwarder for centralized log analysis.

### Skills Learned

- Active Directory management and domain configuration
- Security event monitoring and log analysis using Sysmon and Splunk
- Threat detection and response through attack simulations with Kali Linux
- Centralized data collection with Splunk Forwarder
- Incident response and threat hunting in a monitored AD environment

### Tools Used

- VirtualBox acting as the hypervisor for my virtual machines
- The Windows 10 machine as the target machine
- Kali Linux as the attacker machine
- Splunk as the SIEM of choice to view the event logs
- Splunk Forwarder used to gather logs
